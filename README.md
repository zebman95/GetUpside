There are two approaches to making this code work.

Approach One:
1. Look through the code
2. copy and paste what is applicable into your own stack
3. see what happens, or


Approach Two:
1. create a free account at TestProject.io
2. request an invitation to the test setup in the cloud by emailing Chris at cwsite.ma@gmail.com
3. once given access, download the TestProject Agent, register the agent, and run it on your machine
4. have an android phone available that has the beta application installed on it and the phone is in developer mode
5. connect the phone to your machine running the TestProject agent
6. select the play button for the test called 'GetUpside', select your agent and agent device (your phone should show up here), select Run
